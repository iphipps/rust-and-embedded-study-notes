# Rust embedded

This book is a course on microcontroller-based embedded systems that use Rust as the teach language rather than good 'ol C/C++

This book is not for learning rust.  It is not for learning comprehensive electric circuit theory or electronics.

It does not intend to use any other boards other than the STM32F3DISCOVERY dev board.

## Background

### What is a microcontroller?
_a system_ on a chip.
laptop == processor, RAM sticks, hard drive, ethernet port etc.
microcontroller has thos components built into a chip.

### What can a microcontroller do?

Alot.  _embedded systems_ control breaks of car, wash clothing, print documents, keep you warm, optimize fuel consumption.

They all operate without user intervention even if they expose a ui.  I most of their operation is done on their own.

The _control_ a process. They usually have one or more sensors and one or more acuators.

### When should I use a microcontroller?

Why not raspberry Pi or some other OS board?  Cost.  Microcontrollers are cheaper than computers.
Microcontrollers require fewer compeonents.  The Printed Cirvuit Board (PCB_ is smaller and cheaper.
