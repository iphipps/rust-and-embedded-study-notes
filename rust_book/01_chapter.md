# Getting Started

## Hello World
`rustc {filename}.rs` creates a sibling executable file {filename} that can be run.

Questions:  
* Q: Should that main executable be added to version control?
  * A: Cargo handles that for you.  The short answer is no, don't include it in version control

## Hello Cargo

This dir, with cargo.toml and ./src dir  was generated by running
`cargo new hello_cargo` from parent directory

It generates the Cargo.toml file. (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) toml

`cargo build`
generates a Cargo.lock file and a target dir which is where the compiled code lives.  The target dir is what we should add to our gitignore.

`cargo check` checks if can compile but doesn't compile an executable

`cargo run` builds and runs the built executable.

`cargo build --release` optimizes a for release-worthy code

`cargo --list` shows the available commands with better descriptions that those above
