- ADC - Analogue to Digital Converter 
- ARM - Advanced RISC Machine - family of RISC architectures for computer processors
- ARM Cortex-M - group of 32 bit RISC ARM processor cores.
- ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange - character encoding standard
- Accuracy - a sensor's max difference between actual value and the value indicated at the output
- Boundary scan - method for testing interconnects on printed circuit boards
- DAC - Digital to Analogue Converter
- GDB - The GNU project debugger allows you to see what is going on inside another program while it executes.
- GPIO - General purpose input/output digital signal pin on integrated or electric circuit board.
- I<sup>2</sup>C - Inter-Integrated Circuit - a synchronous multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, singled-ended serial computer bus widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors in short-distance intra-board communication.
- ISA - Instruction set architecture - abstract model of a computer also referred to as computer architecture.
- ITM - Instrumentation Trace Macrocell - ARM's communication protocol for wire debugging
- ITM - Instrumentation Trace Macrocell - communication protocol on top of SWD
- JTAG - joint test action group - an industry standard for verifying designs and testing printed circuit boards after manufacture. 
- LLVM - compiler infrastructure project with a set of compiler and toolchain technologies. Rust, Ruby, Scala, Kotlin, Java bytecode and a bunch more use LLVM in their compilers.
- Linearity - An expression of a sensor's extent to which the actual measured curve departs from the ideal
- MCU - Microcontroller Unit contrasts with microprocessor.  MCU has no operating system.
- OpenOCD - Open On-Chip Debugger - free and open on chip debugging in system programming and boundary scan testing.
- PRCC - Power Reset and Clock Control - STM32's manages system and peripheral clocks
- Precision -  a sensor's reproduce-ability of the result
- RCC - Reset and Clock Control - STM32's solution for managing system and peripheral clocks.
- RISC - Reduced instruction set computer - ISA allows it to have few cycles per instruction(CPI) than a complex instruction set computer(CISC)
- RS-232 - Recommended Standard 232 for serial communication transmission of data from 1960s.
- RTOS - Real Time Operating System - an OS for real time applications
- Range -  a sensor's max and min values that can be measured.
- Register - processor register is a quickly accessible location available to the computer's CPU. Almost all computers load data from a larger memory into registers where it is used for arithmetic operations then manipulated and stored back as either static of dynamic RAM as main memory. Registers are normally measured by a bit size.
- Response time - a sensor's output state changes to new state over a period of time.
- SPI - Serial Peripheral Interface - synchronous communication interface spec used for short distance communication, master-slave full-duplex interface that requires a minimum of 4 wires.
- SWD - Serial Wire Debug - ARM's pin debug port for pin-limited packages (replacement for 5-pin JTAG ports).
- SWD - Serial Wire Debug -- used to send messaged from microcontroller to the debugging host.
- Sensitivity - refers to a sensor's minimum input of physical parameter that will create a detectable output change.
- SoC - Systems-on-chips - Integrated circuit / chip that integrates all 
- SoM - Systems-on-modules - board-level circuit that integrates a system function in a single module. Unlike a single board computer, SoM serves a special function like an SoC.
- Transducer - materials or devices that have the property of converting one kind of energy into another.
- UART - A Universal Asynchronous transmitter
- USART - a Universal Asynchronous/Asynchronous receiver/transmitter
- USB - Universal Serial Bus
- cargo - a package manager and compile/build tool for Rust
- components of a computer or other electronic system - Raspberry Pi uses a system on a chip.
- scalars - a storage location identifier by a memory addressed and paired with a symbolic name - e.g. Integers, floating point numbers, booleans, characters - In Rust, these are contrasted with compound types
