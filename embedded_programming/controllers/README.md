# Micro Controllers

An unexpected challenge of embedded work is micro controller selection.  Determining what micro controllers have which capabilities 
and which can run in the different environments has been significant work.  Here I'd like to capture some of those notes.  Hopefully,
I'll gain at least a basic understanding of what to look for.
