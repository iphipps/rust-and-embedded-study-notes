# Introduction to IOT2x

[edx.org](edx.org) offers a IoT [course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CurtinX+IOT2x+2T2019/course) that you can audit. While not the main goal of this repo, there is some useful information in there.

Specifically, this course does a good job going over the electrical engineering aspects that
the rust embedded book does not.

Like:
transistors
diodes
semiconductors
etc.
