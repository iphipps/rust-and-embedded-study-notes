# Rust and embedded journ(al|ey)

Learning Rust. This repository will hold notes and programs.

## Learning Approach

There are a few rust books that I intend to go through:

- [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) OR `rustup doc --book`
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) OR `rustup doc --rust-by-example`
- [Rust emdedded](https://rust-embedded.github.io/discovery/index.html) OR `rustup doc --embedded-book`

As well as some classes 
- [EdX IoT -- Sensors and devices](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CurtinX+IOT2x+2T2019/course/)
## Goals

- Proficiency in rust, enough to program a microcontroller to do things.
- Proficiency in embedded and microcontrollers.  enough to build things
