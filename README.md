# Rust Journal

Let's learn Rust. This repository will hold notes and programs.

## Learning Approach

There are a few rust books that I intend to go through:

- (Rust Book)[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/] OR `rustup doc --book`
- (Rust By Example)[https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/] OR `rustup doc --rust-by-example`
- (Rust emdedded)[https://rust-embedded.github.io/discovery/index.html] OR `rustup doc --embedded-book`

## Goals

Proficiency in rust, enough to program a microcontroller to do things.
